# signature-Verification-using-CV2
This project focuses on automating the process of signature verification using computer vision techniques with OpenCV, Flask, and Python. It compares two signature images, processes them to extract keypoints, and evaluates their similarity using the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) algorithm.
